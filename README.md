# üß† Brain Tumor Detection & Segmentation App

This project is a **deep learning-based web application** designed to **detect and highlight brain tumors** in MRI images. It uses a combination of **image classification** and **segmentation models** to both identify the presence of a tumor and visually highlight its location.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Upload MRI images for analysis  
- Classify images as **Tumor** or **No Tumor**  
- Segment and highlight the **tumor region** on the image  
- Built using **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**  
- Easy-to-use web interface

## üß© Model Overview

The app consists of two main models:
1. **Classification Model** ‚Äì Detects whether a brain MRI image shows a tumor.  
2. **Segmentation Model** ‚Äì Identifies and highlights the tumor region using pixel-level analysis.  

Both models are trained using the Figshare Brain Tumor Dataset.
